# Preprocessing: Filter key phrases

This notebook is used to filter out all the key phrases when using a whitelist method to match the program requirements (e.g. Work experience).

## Usage

First copy all the lines into cache.txt, then fill in the phrases with possile phrases. After each run, the remaining lines are shown in remaining.txt. Add more phrases accordingly until no more line remains.

## Reminder

After git pull, your temporary result might be overwritten by others! Don't save your progress here.
